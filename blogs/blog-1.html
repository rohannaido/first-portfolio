    <h1>Beginners guide to Health Insurance</h1>
    <small>10 March 2022</small>

    <p>This artice is from ditto.com.<br>Buying insurance is hard. Reading a policy document is even harder. And even if you make an effort to painstakingly go through this thing, you’ll most likely draw a blank because you won’t know what half those words mean. So in a bid to uncomplicate matters and teach you how to read a policy document, we’ve created a set of simple case studies to explain what some of the most common terms and features actually mean. We will also tell you how they impact you and why you may or may not need them. 
        </p>

    <p>So let’s start with the most ubiquitous feature within the health insurance universe— Co-payment.</p>

    <h2>Say no to Co-Payment?</h2>

    <p>You’re about to buy health insurance. The agent pitches a policy with a cover totaling 5 Lakhs for a bargain price of just ₹7000 a year. But then he sweetens the pot even further. He promises to cut down the premium by 25% (roughly ₹1800/year) if only you agree to a 20% co-payment clause. You think that’s amazing and you sign off on the agreement. Wow, you just saved ₹1800.</p>
